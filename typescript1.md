## Learning TypeScript 1
### Setup
* Installed npm installer & setup TypeScript on local machine.
* Init Github Pages
* Visit local directory /typescript/ to see typescript website

### TypeScript
  The language itself seems like a mix between HTML and Java, but using some weird syntax. It has lots of functions over plain HTML, which is nice. Seems interesting in that it has to compile into a .js file to be used properly.

  Seems like a HTML implementation must be used on top of the TypeScript for my project so hopefully I can learn to make the UI pretty.

- Code TypeScript into a js file
- compile js file into a .ts file
