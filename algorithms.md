# Recursive Bubble Sort

So I decided to make the bubble sort algorithm in the rewriting system. Bubble sort is simple, you just go through all the elements in a set of numbers and switch the two neighboring numbers if one's bigger than another.

In a high-level programming language, in its iterative form, its just a nested loop going through all the elements one at a time.
````java
dsfsdfg
````
In recursive format, it becomes this:
````java
ay bum
````

To write it as the rewriting system, I think it is fairly simple:
 - Base case
 - normal case
 - switch function as rewriting system

So here's my version of it:

````iosd
asdf
````
