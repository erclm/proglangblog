### Exercise on TRSs (blog)

Choose a simple algorithm and formulate it as a rewriting system as in the exercise on sorting above. *Write a blog post about it.* Add in as much as you want and can of the material we learned so far, including the lectures on [TRSs](https://hackmd.io/s/BJLCzAKnQ).

What are the signature, variables and equations?
 - a Term Rewriting system is a system whose object are terms, and expressions are within nested sub-expressions.
 - it is basically a set of rules that makes 'l' into a 'r' (l->r).
 - it uses binary operators ( {\displaystyle (\vee )} (\vee ) and (\wedge ) ) and the unary operator {\displaystyle (\neg )} (\neg ).
